This is my first post for my own website! New thing will be coming up soon!

But I would like to share one sentence by Lord Rayleigh which I found
interesting when I was reading **Hydrodynamics Stability by P. G. Drazin, and
W. H. Reid**

**Lord Rayleigh (1884)** *<font size="4">"Science is nothing without generalisations. Detached
and ill-assorted facts are only raw material, and in the absence of a
theoretical solvent, have but little nutritive value."</font>*
