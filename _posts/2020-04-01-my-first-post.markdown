This is my first post for my own website! New thing will be coming up soon!
But I would also like to share what I have read from a book by the Lord Rayleigh (1884)
"Science is nothing without generalisations. Detached and ill-assorted facts are only raw material, 
and in the absence of a theoretical solvent, have but little nutritive value."
